See the page http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html 
for installing Grammatical Framework(GF). At this stage it is advised 
to install from source to get the Nepali resource grammar with GF.

This is just the Nepali resource grammar, you can find the latest 
development code here, it doesn't work separately you need to have GF 
installed to get this running. These sources uses its own 
transliteration system close to developed by MPP.You can see the 
transliteration scheme at translite-nep.txt this comes along with 
GF system so you need not worry about it.

If you made some changes use following commands before re-compiling
your source

Go to cd to ../nepali/ folder and run following command

gf -s <translit.gfs

this will transliterate the files in ../src to Unicode format and 
copies them to ../nepali/ folder

So if you need to change some string that should be in Nepali Unicode,
do so in the files on ../nepali/src and run the command above.

This is work in progress and currently have limited vocabulary but we 
have tried to cover as many different variety of words as possible
so that it will cover most of the constructs of the language

We will soon Release a demo application that allows translation 
between all languages in GF system.

If you are interested working with Nepali grammar and want to contribute
to the project you are most welcome, just drop me a line at
