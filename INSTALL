See the page http://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index.html 
for downloading installing Grammatical Framework(GF). At this stage 
it is advised to install from source to get the Nepali resource grammar 
along with GF.

This gitbut repository is just for the Nepali resource grammar, you can 
find the latest development code here, it doesn't work separately you 
need to have GF installed to get this running. These sources uses its own 
transliteration system that is close to developed by MPP.You can see the 
transliteration scheme at translite-nep.txt this comes along with 
GF system so you need not worry about it.

If you want to use the latest source from here with the GF system then 
download the code and extract/replace 'neplai' folder located at 
../gf/lib/src/nepali with this latest code.

if want to make some changes on the sourec files downloaded from here
the use following commands before re-compiling GF

cd to ../nepali/ folder and run following command

gf -s <translit.gfs

this will transliterate the files in ../nepali/src to Unicode format 
and copies them to ../nepali/ folder

if you need to change some string that should be in Nepali Unicode,
do so in the files on ../nepali/src and run the command above.

This is work in progress and currently have limited vocabulary but we 
have tried to cover as many different variety of words as possible
so that it will cover most of the constructs of the language

We will soon Release a demo application that allows translation 
between all languages in GF system.

If you are interested working with Nepali grammar and want to contribute
