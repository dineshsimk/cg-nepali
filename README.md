## Grammatical Framework, Brief Introduction.


Grammatical Framework(GF) is a programming language for multilingual grammar applications, based on Martin-Löf type theory

GF makes an essential distinction between **abstract syntax** and **concrete syntax**. The abstract syntax represents the structure or meaning of values in the language, whereas the concrete syntax describes their appearance. The idea is that the abstract syntax is easy to analyze and synthesize in a program, and thus does not contain any irrelevant details or redundancy. The abstract syntax might also be shared between grammars for different languages. The concrete syntax, on the other hand, might be designed for readability or redundancy, or in the case of natural languages, evolved rather than designed. The distinction between abstract and concrete syntax is much used in the ﬁeld of computer languages, but less so within computational linguistics.

Concrete syntaxes are written as linearization rules for abstract syntax terms. In other words, the grammar writer deﬁnes how each function in the abstract syntax is converted to a value in the concrete syntax. Using a concrete syntax, the GF system can both parse input to abstract syntax terms and linearize abstract syntax terms to values in the concrete syntax. 

In GF there may be several concrete syntaxes for a single abstract syntax. This may be used to produce output or accept input in any of a number of languages, or to translate between languages. Formal and natural languages might share a common abstract syntax. This can for example be used to translate speciﬁcations in some formal language to informal natural language speciﬁcations.

Another application of multilingual grammars is multilingual syntax editing, where the user edits a document in multiple languages simultaneously by manipulating abstract syntax terms and observing the resulting concrete syntax output for many languages in parallel. This may involve several natural languages [5], or both natural and formal languages. GF is a suitable grammar formalism for general embedded grammars since it is quite powerful while being parsable in polynomial time, and since it can be used for both parsing and linearization, other necessary grammars such as context-free grammars for external systems can be generated from GF grammars.

## To those who are new to Nepali Language

Nepali is the official language of Nepal with around 17 Million native speakers and 21 Million speakers worldwide. It falls under the Indo-Aryan Group of the Indo-European Language family and close to the languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Urdu.

Nepali is a morphologically rich language and uses Devanagari script. Nouns in Nepali inflects for Number and seven cases. Pronouns have seven different honorific forms and they directly belongs to the gender of noun. Verbs in Nepali are quite highly inflected, agreeing with the subject in number, gender, status and person. They also inflect for tense, mood, and aspect. As well as these inflected finite forms, there are also a large number of participial forms.
